This fork allows inputting a .obj file with

```
l [v1] [v2]
```

line-segment indices in addition to faces (basic `f [v1] [v2] [v3]`). There's no
attempt to check that line segments are valid and non-redundant. They shouldn't
be degenerate, copies of each other or copies of edges in the input triangles.

# CDT - Constrained Delaunay Tetrahedrization made robust and practical
This code implements an algorithm to calculate a Constrained Delaunay Tetrahedrization (CDT) of an input PLC represented by on OFF file.
Steiner points are possibly added to make the input admit a CDT.
Details of the algorithm are described in "**Constrained Delaunay Tetrahedrization: A robust and practical approach**" by L. Diazzi, D. Panozzo, A. Vaxman and M. Attene (ACM Trans Graphics Vol 42, N. 6, Procs of SIGGRAPH Asia 2023).

## Usage
Clone this repository with:
```
git clone https://github.com/MarcoAttene/CDT
```

Once done, you may build the executable as follows:
```
cmake -B build -S .
```

This will produce an appropriate building configuration for your system.
On Windows MSVC, this will produce a cdt.sln file.
On Linux/MacOS, this will produce a Makefile. 
Use it as usual to compile cdt. Alternatively, you can use the command line:
```
cmake --build build --config Release
```

When compiled, the code generates an executable called ``cdt``.
Launch it with no command line parameters to have a list of supported options.

Example:

```
cdt input_file.off
```
creates a file called ``input_file.off.tet`` representing the constrained tetrahedrization.


We tested our code on Linux (GCC-11), MacOS (GCC-11 and CLANG) and Windows (MSVC 2022 with both CL and CLANG).
